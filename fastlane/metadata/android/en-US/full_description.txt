    * Detect pitch based on autocorrelation and FFT spectrum.
    * Accuracy improvement by evaluating the spectrum phase information and polynomial fitting.
    * Show how pitch changes over time.
    * Basic instrument database (chromatic, guitar, bass, violin, ...)
    * Support for custom instruments
    * Several temperaments like equal, just, Werckmeister, Kirnberger, ...
    * Non-12-tone temperaments (EDO 17, 19, ..., 41, 53)
