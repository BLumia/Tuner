# Tuner

This is a basic tuner app. 

# Features

These features might change over time and I am not sure if this list will always be up to date.
* Detect pitch based on autocorrelation and FFT spectrum
* Accuracy improvement by evaluating the spectrum phase information and polynomial fitting
* Show how pitch changes over time
* Tuning to equal temperament
* Settings for choosing concert pitch, FFT window size, FFT window type, overlap and more.
